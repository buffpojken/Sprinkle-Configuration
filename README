Installation Process
-----------------------

This process will guide you from a barebones fresh install of Ubuntu (tested on
Hardy Heron och Jaunty Jackalope) to a full-blow Rails-stack hosting solution.
This script needs to run as root on the server, but please remember to disable the
root-user afterwards!

$ = Run this on your local machine
# = Run this as root on the server


1. Install sprinkle;
$ sudo gem install sprinkle

2. Download the recipe from http://github.com/buffpojken/Sprinkle-Configuration/tree

3. Move to the directory you just downloaded from github.
$ cd PATH_TO_DIR

4. Ping the server to make sure you have the correct ip.
$ ping IP_TO_SERVER

5. Edit deploy.rb in the Sprinkle Configuration; replace IP_TO_HOST with the ip of the server

6. Run the provisioning scripts
$ sprinkle -s setup.rb

7. When prompted, provide the root-password to the server

8. When done, disable the root-user on the server!


Notes
-----------------------

At the moment, running this on a fresh GleSYS-vps throws few errors but nothing breaks. 
This is due to /tmp being mounted as noexec from the start, to fix this - log in to the
server as root and go to /etc/fstab. Edit parameters to allow exec from /tmp - this will make
the errors go away.
